### **ðŸ“š What You'll Learn**  
1. **C++ Basics:**  
   - Syntax and structure of C++ programs.  
   - Input/output operations with `cin` and `cout`.  
   - Variables, data types, and memory management.  
   - Operators: Arithmetic, relational, logical, and unary.  
   - Control structures: Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`) and conditionals (`if`, `else`, `switch`).  

2. **Data Structures:**  
   - Arrays and strings.  
   - Linked lists (singly, doubly, circular).  
   - Stacks and queues.  
   - Trees (binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees).  
   - Graphs (representation and traversal algorithms).  
   - Hash tables and hashing techniques.
